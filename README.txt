
The system manages the cryptocurrencies for several investors, and coordinate the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.
The system is a major simplification of cryptocurrency markets, including a very simplified blockchain system,
minimal mining and no cryptography. It will work on text-based input that should be processed line-by-line.
The input will have commands that are recognized by the system and the output will be written to standard output.
Cryptocurrencies use these blockchains to (in our simplification) list of all the transactions that
the cryptocurrency has been involved in.
Whenever a unit of the cryptocurrency is traded, the
information about that trade is added to the list of transactions. 
The list is never modified (using
cryptography in the real world) but only appended to, and any observer can detect if any part of
the blockchain list has been modified.



!Instructions for compiling ! ---------------------------------------
"ProgramRun.java: Contains main method
Place the TestFile in the same folder as .Java files 

Type : javac ProgramRun.java
then Type : java ProgramRun

program will ask to type in the Testfile name which is in the same directory
